Lightweight “entry points” to run common tasks (makes your repo reproducible and professional).
Shell (.sh) or batch (.bat) scripts for reproducibility:
- run_data_gen.sh → runs expert trajectory generation
- train_transformer.sh → launches training with configs
- evaluate_generalization.sh → runs tests on modified gravity environments
Example content:
# scripts/train_transformer.sh
python -m src.training.train_transformer --config configs/transformer_baseline.yaml
