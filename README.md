# lunar-transformer-il
Exploring decoder-only transformer models for Imitation Learning (IL). The models are trained on data generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents solving the Lunar Lander v3 environment of Gymnasium, a maintained fork of OpenAI’s Gym library, which is an API standard for RL with a diverse collection of environments.

### Data and dataset generation.

We need expert data to perform our experiments. Running `scripts/run_expert_data_gen.py` simulates multiple episodes of the Lunar Lander v3 environment with a trained actor-critic model controling it, and the raw data is saved within `data/raw`.

Once the raw expert data exists we can run `scripts/run_dataset_gen.py`, which uses this data to create a custom `torch.nn.Dataset` comprising of pairs of sequences (intercalated state space vectors and actions) and labels (actions to be taken given a specific sequence). This dataset is saved within `data/processed`.

### Setting up the environment

This project was developed using a conda environment. All the packages names and versions necessary to run the scripts are detailed in the `environment.yml` file. Run `conda create -f environment.yml` to it setup.
