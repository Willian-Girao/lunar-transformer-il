# lunar-transformer-il
Exploring decoder-only transformer models for Imitation Learning (IL). The models are trained on data generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents solving the Lunar Lander v3 environment of Gymnasium, a maintained fork of OpenAI’s Gym library, which is an API standard for RL with a diverse collection of environments.
